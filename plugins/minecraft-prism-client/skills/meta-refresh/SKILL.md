# Minecraft Prism Mods Meta Refresh

Audit a Prism Launcher Fabric instance to determine whether each mod is still best-in-class, find better alternatives using live Modrinth data, record approved decisions to a shared decision doc, then chain to version-refresh.

## Inputs

Ask for any of these not already provided:

- **Prism instance name** — auto-detect by listing `C:/Users/leole/AppData/Roaming/PrismLauncher/instances/`
- **Target MC version** — e.g. `1.21.11`
- **Modloader** — default: `Fabric`
- **Player profile** — default: vanilla+ Fabric client (performance, subtlety, no gameplay changes). Explicitly excluded: minimap/world map mods, block/entity info overlays (Jade, WAILA, etc.), persistent HUD overlays if BetterF3 or equivalent is already present, any mod that reveals world information not accessible in vanilla.
- **Reference packs** — default: DisruptiveBuilds REFINED (`dbs-minecraft-refined`) and PLUS (`dbs-minecraft-plus`) on Modrinth
- **Server SSH host** *(optional)* — e.g. `minecraft`. If provided, check server plugins via `ssh <host> "ls /home/minecraft/serverfiles/plugins/"` to determine which server-side companions are active (DHSupport enables DH LOD sync; Lithium and Krypton are primarily server-side — client-only installs have partial benefit).
- **Decision doc path** — if passed from audit, use it. Otherwise: `./minecraft-audits/prism-<instance-name>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create if not exists)

---

## Read-only phases

No files are written in this section.

### Phase 1 — Categorize

If a server host was provided, fetch active plugins:
```bash
ssh <host> "ls /home/minecraft/serverfiles/plugins/"
```
Note server-side companions — affects verdicts for client mods with server-side counterparts (e.g. DHSupport enables DH LOD sync, Lithium/Krypton have server-side performance components).

Read `<instance>/.minecraft/mods/` (include `.disabled` files). Assign each mod to exactly one category:

| Category | Example mods |
|----------|-------------|
| `performance` | sodium, ferritecore, entityculling, dynamic-fps, noisium |
| `rendering` | iris, continuity, entity_texture_features, entity_model_features |
| `audio` | sound-physics-remastered, sounds |
| `hud-ui` | appleskin, BetterF3, durabilitytooltip, modmenu, lighty |
| `qol` | MouseTweaks, smoothscroll, AutoWalk, camerautils, PickUpNotifier |
| `shaders` | shader packs, EuphoriaPatcher |
| `library` | fabric-api, cloth-config, yet-another-config-lib, etc. |
| `disabled` | any `.disabled` mod — track separately, note why disabled if inferable |

Output: category → [mod list] map.

### Phase 2 — Parallel Category Agents

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents** — use it to dispatch and manage all category agents.

Run one general-purpose agent per non-library, non-disabled category. Dispatch all with `run_in_background: true`.

Read `./category-agent-prompt.md` (in this skill's directory) for the full agent prompt template. Inject per-agent values (category name, user mods, MC version, modloader, server-side companions) from Phase 1.

When constructing sub-agent prompts, resolve all relative paths (like `../compat-check/SKILL.md`) to absolute paths using this skill's base directory before injecting.

Wait for all agents to complete before Phase 3.

### Phase 3 — Synthesize

- Merge all Category Reports into one list.
- Resolve conflicts (same mod recommended by two agents — use the one with more supporting data).
- De-duplicate gap candidates.

### Phase 4 — Upgrade Plan

Build the numbered upgrade plan from all category reports. Read `./upgrade-plan-format.md` (in this skill's directory) for the exact output format and table rules.

After presenting the plan, tell the user:

> Reply with:
> - **"approve all"** — apply every proposed change
> - **"approve 1,3"** — apply only items #1 and #3
> - **"skip 2"** — approve all except #2
> - **"cancel"** — abort, no changes made

**No files are written until the user explicitly responds.**

---

## Write phases

Files are written only after the user responds to the upgrade plan.

### Phase 5 — Write Decision Doc

**Decision doc path:** `./minecraft-audits/prism-<instance-name>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Create `./minecraft-audits/` if it doesn't exist. Create the file if it doesn't exist. If it already exists (created by audit), append to it.

**Header (write at top if creating):**

```md
# Minecraft Audit — YYYY-MM-DD
Instance: <name>
MC Version: <version>
Modloader: <loader>
```

**Meta decisions section (always append):**

```md
## Meta decisions
| # | Action | Mod | Alternative | Decision |
|---|--------|-----|-------------|----------|
| 1 | ADD | Lithium | — | approved |
| 2 | REPLACE | flow | Smooth Gui | skipped |
| 3 | REMOVE | noisium | — | approved |
```

Use `approved`, `skipped`, or `cancelled` in the Decision column.

### Phase 6 — Chain to Version-Refresh

After writing the decision doc, say:

> Meta audit complete. Decision doc saved to `./minecraft-audits/prism-<instance-name>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
>
> Proceed to version-refresh? **(yes / cancel)**

- **If yes:** Say "Invoking `version-refresh`." and invoke it, passing the decision doc path and instance name.
- **If cancel:** Ask: "Delete the decision doc to keep tidy, or save it for a future run? **(delete / keep)**" — act on response.

---

## Failure Handling

If any phase produces unexpected results — malformed agent output, Modrinth API errors, agents returning empty or garbled Category Reports — invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging` before retrying or escalating to the user.

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Recommending mods without running compat-check** — every mod verdict and every gap candidate MUST have a verified compat status. This is the #1 failure mode.
- **Trusting Modrinth search facets as proof of exact-version builds** — the `versions:X` facet uses minor-series matching, not exact matching. Always call the `/version` endpoint to confirm.
- **Writing files before user approval** — Phases 1-4 are strictly read-only. No decision doc writes until the user responds to the upgrade plan.
- **Recommending mods that violate vanilla+ profile** — never recommend minimap, world map, block/entity info overlays, or mods that reveal non-vanilla information.

## Meta Signal Sources (priority order)

1. Modrinth download count + `date_modified` for target MC version — primary signal
2. Presence in DisruptiveBuilds REFINED or PLUS pack — validation signal
3. GitHub stars + last push date — tiebreaker for close calls
